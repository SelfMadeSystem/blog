My animated You.com logo has been getting a lot of attention lately and a lot of people have been asking
me questions about it. So I thought I'd write a blog post about how I made it and how you can make your
own animated logo too.

> **Note:** This post is not affiliated with You.com in any way. I just had a little fun with their logo.

import YouCom from "../../components/youcom/Full.astro";

<div class="w-fit mx-auto">
  <YouCom />
</div>

## Step 1: Designing the logo

This is the most important step in creating an animated logo. You need to have a clear idea of what you
want your logo to look like and how you want it to move. I kinda cheated here because I already had the
You.com logo designed by a professional designer. The easiest way to make the logo animated is to have
it designed using strokes instead of fills.

## Step 2: Animating the logo

I originally used <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> to animate the
logo, but I found that it wasn't supported in all browsers and it has some performance issues. So I
decided to use <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> animations instead.

In non-technical terms, the basic idea is to draw parts of the outline of the logo in a sequence to make
it look like it's being drawn. I used the `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` properties in CSS to
achieve this effect. The astute reader will notice that the animation is infinite, looping back on itself
like a snake eating its own tail. This is very much inspired by Material Design's loading animations (which
I am very fond of).

Let's start by replicating Material Design's loading animation. The `stroke-dasharray` property defines the
length of the dashes and the gaps in the stroke. This is the first key ingredient to the animation.

First, we'll need a circle. I'll be using this:

```html
<svg
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  fill="none"
  viewBox="0 0 64 64"
  height="64"
  width="64"
>
  <path
    stroke-linejoin="round"
    stroke-linecap="round"
    stroke-width="10"
    stroke="black"
    d="M 32 32
        m 0 -27
        a 27 27 0 1 1 0 54
        a 27 27 0 1 1 0 -54"
    class="spin"
    pathLength="360"
  ></path>
</svg>
```

<br />

> **Note:** The `pathLength` attribute is used to define the length of the path. This is used to calculate
> the length of the dashes and gaps in the stroke. A value of `360` is used here just to make it easier to
> deal with.

Then we'll need some CSS to animate the circle. I'll just be using `stroke-dasharray` for now:

```css
.circle {
  animation: dash 2s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes dash {
  0% {
    stroke-dasharray: 0 360;
  }

  50% {
    stroke-dasharray: 360 0;
  }

  100% {
    stroke-dasharray: 0 360;
  }
}
```

<br />

This is the result:

import Step1 from "../../components/youcom/Step1.astro";

<div class="w-fit mx-auto">
  <Step1 />
</div>

As you can see, the circle is going from an empty circle to a full circle and back to an empty circle.
However, the stroke goes back to the start. If we compare it with the Material Design loading animation,
we can see that the when the stroke shrinks again, it moves forwards to the end. We can achieve this by
adding a few more entries to the `stroke-dasharray` property. If we replace `0 360` with `0 0 360 0`,
we're saying that the first dash is 0, the first gap is 0, the second dash is 360, and the second gap is 0.
This looks the same as `0 360`, but having the `0 0` at the start allows us to move the stroke forward
when the circle is shrinking by changing it to `0 360 0 360` (first dash 0, then a gap of 360).

Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.circle {
  animation: dash 2s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes dash {
  0% {
    stroke-dasharray: 0 0 0 360;
  }

  50% {
    stroke-dasharray: 0 0 360 0;
  }

  100% {
    stroke-dasharray: 0 360 0 360;
  }
}
```

<br />

This is the result:

import Step2 from "../../components/youcom/Step2.astro";

<div class="w-fit mx-auto">
  <Step2 />
</div>

It's not spinning, though. There's a few different ways to make it spin. We can use the `transform` or
`rotate` properties in CSS to rotate the circle, or we can use the `stroke-dashoffset` property to move
the stroke around the circle. I'll be using the `stroke-dashoffset` property because it's easier to
control the speed of the rotation. If we keep the `stroke-dasharray` as it is, we'll see that there's a
random dot that appears. This is because `stroke-dasharray` loops back to the start when it reaches the
end. Since `0 0` is not the same as `0 360`, the looping back causes a dot to appear. We can fix this by
just duplicating the last two values in the `stroke-dasharray` so it never loops back to the start.

Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.circle {
  animation:
    dash 2s linear infinite,
    spin 2s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes dash {
  0% {
    stroke-dasharray: 0 0 0 360 0 360;
  }

  50% {
    stroke-dasharray: 0 0 360 0 360 0;
  }

  100% {
    stroke-dasharray: 0 360 0 360 0 360;
  }
}

@keyframes spin {
  0% {
    stroke-dashoffset: 0;
  }

  100% {
    stroke-dashoffset: 360;
  }
}
```

<br />

This is the result:

import Step3 from "../../components/youcom/Step3.astro";

<div class="w-fit mx-auto">
  <Step3 />
</div>

## Step 3: Adding the text

Now that we have the spinning circle, we can add the text. You probably noticed that I used a `path`
element instead of a `circle` element. This is because the `path` element is more versatile and can be
used to create more complex shapes. All you need to do is take the outline of any character you want and
use it as the `d` attribute of the `path` element. You can use a tool like
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) to trace the outline of any character and export it as an `svg` file.

Here's an example of how you can use the outline of the letter "Y" as the `d` attribute of the `path`:

import Step4 from "../../components/youcom/Step4.astro";

<div class="w-fit mx-auto">
  <Step4 />
</div>

You can use the same CSS animation we used for the circle to animate the text.

## Step 4: Putting it all together

Now that we have the spinning circle and the animated text, we can put it all together to create the
animated You.com logo. My logo is a little more complex than this (it also has gradients and the circle
is animated differently), but this should give you a good starting point. This is what the animated logo
would look like without the extra fancy stuff (+ `ease-in-out` for the `dash` animation to make it look
smoother):

import Step5 from "../../components/youcom/Step5.astro";

<div class="w-fit mx-auto">
  <Step5 />
</div>

## Conclusion

And that's how I made the animated You.com logo. I hope you found this post helpful and that it inspires
you to create your own animated logo. If you have any questions or need help with anything, feel free to
